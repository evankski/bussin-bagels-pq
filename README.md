You will have 30 seconds to build the best bagel sandwich that you can! Catch every ingrendient that would be on your bagel sandwich, if you catch anything that you wouldn't want to eat you lose!
You will be able to use your arrow keys to move your bagel back and fourth. Ingredients you would want to catch include: ham, lettuce, tomato, mayo, and bacon! 
Make sure to watch out for the cockroaches, if you get one of those on your bagel you lose! Who would want to eat a cockroach, right?

# MVP 
* Created a game canvas that containes a bagel, ingrediets (bacon, lettuce, tomato, mayo, ham), a cockroach, a 30second timer, and a score tracker
* Made a start/restart button
* If you touch a cockroach, all intervals stop and it shows "Game Over" with your score
* if you reach the 30 second timer, it will say "time's up" followed by your score
* a full screen to move back and forth using arrow keys or A and D keys


# Completed Stretch Goals
* Added background music
* Added sound when items are collected
* Had all ingredients spawn at a random patten each game and wave
