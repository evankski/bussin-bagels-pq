# What is bussin bagels?
You will have 30 seconds to build the best bagel sandwich that you can! Catch every ingrendient that would be on your bagel sandwich, if you catch anything that you wouldn't want to eat you lose!
You will be able to use your arrow keys to move your bagel back and fourth. Ingredients you would want to catch include: turkey, ham, lettuce, tomato, mayo, and bacon! 
Make sure to watch out for the cockroaches, if you get one of those on your bagel you lose! Who would want to eat a cockroach, right?

I will be using canvas to complete this project.

# MVP 
* A rendered start screen with a button that starts the game
* Game screen that contains a bagel, a 30second timer, and a scoreboard
* Have a restart button
* Lettuce, tomato, bacon, turkey, ham, mayo, and cockroach elemnts that drop down the screen
* A screen that shows you lost if you catch a cockroach
* Three sections for your bagel to alternate between
* A end of game screen that shows how many ingredients you picked up
  
  # Stretch Goals
* a +1 next to your bagel everytime you grab a new ingredient
* Have the ingredients be random every game
* When you get closer to the end of the game the speed starts to increase  
  
# Roadblocks </h1>
* Making sure the bagel doesn't go off screen
* Having pictures for the elements
* Making the ingredients random every game
* Increasing the speed for the cockroach
